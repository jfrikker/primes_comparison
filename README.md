# primes_comparison

This project compares execution times for a specific prime generation algorithm in a variety of languages.

Each language builds an executable that prints out an ordered list of all primes. It take a single argument: The maximum prime to generate.

Sample results:

```
C++     found 664579 primes and took  1.48 seconds.
Rust    found 664579 primes and took  1.59 seconds.
Java    found 664579 primes and took  2.33 seconds.
Pypy    found 664579 primes and took  5.52 seconds.
Haskell found 664579 primes and took 11.31 seconds.
Python  found 664579 primes and took 38.15 seconds.
